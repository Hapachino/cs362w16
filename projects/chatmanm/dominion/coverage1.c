For this assignment, we implemented test functions based on actions from the game and abilities from the cards.
These tests were a sanity for coverage in our implementation to test if the game followed the rules.

I was able to generate 100% coverage for all four unit tests but unfortunately, coverage returned a 0% for all four card
tests. I believe the coverage wasn't implemented correctly because of the deprecated warnings. This will require more
tweaking possibly with using floor with the Random function.
