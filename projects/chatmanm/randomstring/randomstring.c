inputChar()
As the assignment specified, it mentioned to generate a random character so I implemented a simple return statement that
returns letters.

inputString()
Since the program needs a variable that contains the characters 'r,e,s,t' to produce the error, I stored those values in an
array along with temporary string array. Entering the for loop, values from the string array will be stored in the temporary
string array. Order of the character does not matter, as long as it contains those values, the program will exit.

Sometimes the test takes a very long time and there are other times it may be quick. It really just depends on the
different possiblities of combinations. For example, one test took 1,567,351 iterations and another test took 657,378.
