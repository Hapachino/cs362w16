\
Description\
===========\
The smithy card allows the player to draw three cards after it is played but\
the player only draws two cards. Any player that uses this card has a\
disadvantage based on a missed opportunity obtaining an useful card on their\
third draw.\
\
\
Steps to Produce/Reproduce\
--------------------------\
Run an exact test that calls the function cardEffect for the smithy card. \
Pay attention to the player that is drawing the extra cards and confirm the\
handCount has increased by two because although the player draws three, they\
also discard a card at the end of their turn.\
\
\
Expected Results\
----------------\
Current player should draw three cards and their handCount should increase by\
two. i.e.: expected handCount = 5 should return handCount = 7.\
\
\
Actual Results\
--------------\
The player only drew two cards and then they discard one card leaving them with\
one card.\
i.e.: actual handCount = 6.\
