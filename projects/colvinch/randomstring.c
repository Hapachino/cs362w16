Assignment:  Implement a random tester for the function testme() in testme.c that is capable of printing the error message. You should implement inputChar() and inputString() to produce random values. Write up the development of your random tester and how it finds the error message as randomstring.c. Submit testme.c and randomstring.c under your onid directory in class github. (under your onid directory and not under dominion directory).

The first step in creating my random tester was identifying the circumstances that would cause the error message to be displayed. The cirumstances were determined to be when the state was equal to 9 and the first five characters of the inputString() spelled "reset\0". When the inputChar() value was one of 9 predetermined characters, it had the ability to affect the value of state during the while loop in the testme() function.

The second step in creating my random tester was implementing inputChar() and inputString(). To save time, inputChar() was implemented to randomly select from a limited set of 9 characters, the same 9 characters that testme() would be checking for "[](){} ax". In the same way, inputString() was implemented to return a *string of 6 characters, which was created by randomly selecting from the letters "reset" with the last character being set to the null terminator "/0".
