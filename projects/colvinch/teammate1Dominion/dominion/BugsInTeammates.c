Teammate 1 village code -- No bug found.

Teammate 2 -- could not get code to compile, seems to be disagreement between dominion.h and dominion.c

Teammate 3 adventurer code -- No bug found. (looking at Teammate 3's adventurer code myself, I can spot the bug, and see
why my test did not catch it -- the bug adds too many treasures to the hand, but my test only looks at the last two cards
in the hand.)
Teammate 3 village code --No bug found.
