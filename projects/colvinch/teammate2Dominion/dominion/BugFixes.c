/*
	From bernarca:
		Issues found:
			could not get code to compile, seems to be disagreement between dominion.h and dominion.c

		Notes:
			Can't replicate the issue on my end, so went through the .c and .h files to make sure all functions match
			changed declarations for the play card functions I created.
