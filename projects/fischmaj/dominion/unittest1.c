/***************************************************************************
 ** unittest1.c ( test of shuffle() function) 
 ** Jeremy Fischman
 ** 
 ** This program is a unit test of the shuffle function.  It tests that the
 ** shuffle function complies with the following business rules: 
 **
 ** 1. The function accepts 1 player and a game state, and the discard deck
 ** of the chosen player is permuted. 
 **
 ** 2. Should result in the same number of total cards in the player's deck
 **    following shuffling.
 ** 
 ** 3. Should result in the same number of each type of card in the player's
 **    deck following shuffling as existed in the deck before shuffling
 ** 
 ** 4. The permutation after shuffling should look relatively random (i.e.
 **    the order of cards should be varied somewhat randomly).
 ** 
 ** 5. The other features of the state of the game should all be unchanged.
