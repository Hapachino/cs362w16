/***************************************************************************
 ** cardtest1.c ( test of smithy functions) 
 ** Jeremy Fischman
 ** 
 ** This program is a unit test of the playSmithy() function.  It tests that
 ** playSmithy() complies with the following business rules: 
 **
 ** 1. The function accepts 1 player, a game state, and a hand position
 **
 ** 2. Should result in the next 3 cards from the player's deck moving to 
 **    his hand. 
 **
 ** 3. The smithy card should be removed from the player's hand, and go to
 **    the discard deck. 
 ** 
 ** 4. deckCount should decrease by 3.
 **
 ** 5. handCount should increase by 2 (3 more cards, but smithy discarded). 
 **
 ** 6. discardCount should increase by 1 (for smithy card). 
 ** 
 ** 7. The other features of the state of the game should all be unchanged.
