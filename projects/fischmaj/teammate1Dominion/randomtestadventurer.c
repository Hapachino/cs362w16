/***************************************************************************
 ** randomtestadventurer.c ( test of adventurer functions) 
 ** Jeremy Fischman
 ** 
 ** This program is a unit test of the playAdventurer() function including a
 ** random tester.  It tests that playAdventurer() complies with the following
 ** business rules: 
 **
 ** 1. The function accepts a game state, and a player
 **
 ** 2. Should result in the cards drawn from the deck until 2 treasures are
 **    found.
 **
 ** 3. The two treasures should be added to the hand
 ** 
 ** 4. Other cards should be discarded & discardCount increase by total - 2.
 **
 ** 5. handCount should increase by 2. 
 **
 ** 6. deckCount should decrease by the total number drawn.  
 ** 
 ** 7. The other features of the state of the game should all be unchanged.
