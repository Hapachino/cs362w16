Assignment 3 - Gerald Gale

FUNCTION TESTS:
discardCard()	- 	No errors 
shuffle()		-	No errors
isGameOver()	- 	No errors 
buyCard()		-	ERROR! The hand count did not correctly increase with the buy 

CARD TESTS:
callSmithyCard()		-	ERROR! Program would not quite
callAdventurerCard()	-	ERROR! Several core dumps, and return value wouldn't work
callVillageCard()		-	ERROR! Hand counts never matched 
callEmbargoCard()		-	ERROR! Tokens weren't correct

ALL of these cards had problems and showed errors. This is at least partly because they are all functions/cards
that I had worked with in making problems from Assignment 2. This portion was actually much more frustrating than I thought. 
The main reason being, I forgot that I had added these propblems, some of which I did quite remmeber! In addition, there was a 
for loop that was infinitely going. 


NOTE TO GRADER!
I had numerous problems with callAdventurerCard(). Several core dumps. If there are any issues on your end please let me know. 
Sometimes I was able to get proper results somtimes I was not.

In all though, these tests properly found the issues that were there.
