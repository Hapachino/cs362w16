Explanation of testIsValid
Each iteration of the do-while loop generates one url and runs it through the URLValidator class’ isValid method, then outputs according to whether or not the test was successful. The for-loop inside the do-loop constructs a URL by combining smaller parts of a URL, some of which are valid parts, and others of which aren’t.


How many total number of urls are being tested?
538,650


Explanation of urls being created
It uses testPartsIndex as a counter to combine every possible mashup of the elements in our resultsPair arrays, such that each individual URL will contain one element from each of these arrays.

The parts of the url have been separated into 5 sections: scheme, authority, port, path, and query. When the url is created, they are placed into an array in that order, so the result will look like:

<scheme><authority><port><path><query>


Example of valid and invalid url being tested
Valid: http://www.google.com:65535/t123?action=view

Invalid: 3ht://0.0.0.0:-1/$23?action=edit&mode=up


Do you think that a real world test is very different than the unit tests and card tests that we wrote? Explain in few lines.
In the real world, more emphasis tends to be placed on testing the end results than unit testing each function, since deadlines and supply / demand restrict your ability to do full tests, so that more focus can be placed on things the end-user will be likely to notice. Also in a less ‘staged’ environment, bugs can slip by easier when you’re not given a known-buggy piece of code for the sake of learning. However in the real world, coverage is still a very important factor, just like in this course. 100% coverage is often an impossible ideal in the fast-paced industry.
