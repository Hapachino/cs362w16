My main focus for the random tester was to create the conditions needed to get the error message.
This is how approached Assignment 3 as well. When you know how to break the code or what you are
looking for then it is easier to program to find it. The test I made really doesn't do much. It
creates a pool of non-random elements (ones I know will cause trouble) and then randomly pulls
from them.
