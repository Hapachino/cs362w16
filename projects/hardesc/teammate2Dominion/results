TEST 1: DRAW 2 TREASURE CARDS - player has 2 new treasure cards - 1 discard
	handCount = 3, expected = 2	FAIL
	treasureCount = 2, expected = 2	PASS

TEST 2: CARDS TAKEN FROM DECK/DISCARD - deck + discard has 2 fewer cards 
	discardCount + deckCount = 500; expected = 500	PASS
	Card at adventurer position is still adventurer after played: 	TRUE

TEST 3: PLAYED CARDS PILE - advevnturer card is played 
	playedCardsCount = 0, expected = 1	FAIL

TEST 4: NO STATE CHANGE - state remains unchanged in unaffected variables
	Supply Counts:	PASS

	Other Player States:
		Player[1]: 
		testG.handCount[1] = 5; expected = 5	PASS
		testG.deckCount[1] = 8; expected = 8	PASS
		testG.discardCount[1] = 12; expected = 12	PASS
