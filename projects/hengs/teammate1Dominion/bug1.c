Pretty much the only bugs found were the ones I put there originally. Whether this is because
there were no bugs to find or because my test suite is incomplete I don't know. However, here
is a list of those bugs:

Smithy Bug: Playing Smithy cause each other player to draw an extra card much like Council Room
Adventurer Bug: Ignores copper cards. Will only count gold or silver cards for the treasures.
Village Bug: Causes the other players to discard one card as well as the current player.
