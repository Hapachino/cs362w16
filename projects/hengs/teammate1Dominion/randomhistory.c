2016.02.13: These random test for randomtestadventurer and randomcardtest are updated versions of the
			unit test I made for the adventurer and village card. Currently there is not much of a history
			for these random tests as I just made them. When I originally designed my unit tests I did so 
			with random testing in mind so they both utilized it. I did make an attempt to improve overall
			coverage my upping the number of tests ran from 2000 to 5000. More test will mean a better 
			likelihood that small test cases will trigger more often. Again major lacks of coverage are
			accounted for by certain pass or fail branches not running when the opposite event happens. This
			is the expected output.
