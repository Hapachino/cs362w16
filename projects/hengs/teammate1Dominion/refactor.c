I mostly kept the same functions from dominion.h for ease. Though I did make a few tweaks.

Smithy Bug: Playing Smithy cause each other player to draw an extra card much like Council Room
Adventurer Bug: Ignores copper cards. Will only count gold or silver cards for the treasures.
Village Bug: Causes the other players to discard one card as well as the current player.
Council Room Bug: Each other player gets two cards instead of the normal one
