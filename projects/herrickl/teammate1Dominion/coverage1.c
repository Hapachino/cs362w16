 Assignment 3 coverage1.c

 Lines executed:32.15% of 647
 Branches executed:32.85% of 417
 Taken at least once:25.18% of 417
 
 
 This isn't critical yet as I haven't tested the majority of the code yet.
 
 fullDeckCount() had full coverage.
 isGameOver() had full coverage.
 updateCoins() had full coverage. 
 gainCard() had full coverage.
 
 playAdventurer() had full coverage.
 playSmithy() has full coverage.
 village has full coverage.
 great_hall has full coverage.
 
 Branch coverage was similar to the lines executed above, not significant 
 as I haven't tested the majority of the code base.
 
 Boundary coverage was pretty good based on gcov.
 
 I got really caught up in testing Adventurer and Smithy, because
 for whatever reason I forgot that I had added bugs to that code.  
 That mistake lead to a lot of frustration!!
 
 I was able to reuse quite a bit of code (specifically foundCardInHand) 
 which helped speed up testing.
