Explain testIsValid Function of UrlValidator test code.
First, it instantiates a new UrlValidator object.  Then it calls urlVal.isValid(url) on two valid variants of the Google url.  Then it runs through the testObjects using the testPartsIndex, which is initialized in the call to the setUp() function.  It iterates through each test case, calling urlVal.isValid(url) and checking that the resulting boolean value matches what is expected.

Give how many total number of urls testIsValid is testing.
1,890 URLs are tested.

Explain how it is building all the urls.
It combines a set of hosts with different permutations of protocols, port numbers, paths, and parameters.  For each host, it tries port numbers 0, 80, 65636, and providing no port number.  For each permutation of those it tries protocols http, ftp, and h3t (an invalid protocol).  For each of these permutations it tries the following paths:
/test1?action=view
/test1?action=edit&mode=up
/test1
/t123?action=view
/t123?action=edit&mode=up
/t123
/$23?action=view
/$23?action=edit&mode=up
/$23
/test1/?action=view
/test1/?action=edit&mode=up
/test1/
?action=view
?action=edit&mode=up
/test1/file?action=view
/test1/file?action=edit&mode=up
/test1/file

It also tests that permutation with no path attached.  These represent various permutation of items that might appear in a URL path. 


Give an example of valid url being tested and an invalid url being tested by testIsValid() method.
Valid url: http://www.google.com
Invalid url: h3t://www.google.com:80

Do you think that a real world test (URL Validator's testIsValid() test in this case) is very different than the unit tests and card tests that we wrote (in terms of concepts & complexity)? Explain in few lines. 
The card tests are more complex, because several aspects of the game state must be checked for side effects after each action.  The URL validator only has to check the format of a single string.  There are no side effects to test for.  You only need to check that isValid returns the correct boolean value.
