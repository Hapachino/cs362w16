  The only bug I encountered during testing was when I forgot what I had altered in the dominion.c file. I forgot that some of the tests were supposed to fail due to the bad code that I was feeding it. Luckily, I realized quickly that it was a good thing that they were failing. Realizing this, I was better able to make sure the tests were catching what they were supposed to.
