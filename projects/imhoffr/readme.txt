Hi!  I'm Regina Imhoff imhoffr@oregonstate.edu.
I'm StabbyMcDuck on github though and throughout the rest of the interwebs.

Assignment 3:
  -The command "make unittestresults.out" will work. 
    -Compile all 8 tests
    -Execute all 8 tests
    -Add any output information to unittestresults.out
    -Collect coverage information
    -Append all that information to unittestresults.out

To play:
  use 'playdom' followed by a space and a number.
  example:  playdom 3


added herrickl and mcleodki directories:
  mkdir mcleodki && cp -R ../mcleodki/dominion mcleodki/
