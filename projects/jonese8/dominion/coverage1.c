File 'dominion.c'

dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

After executing all 4 unit tests and 4 card tests only 39.97% of the 578 lines 
of statements in dominion.c were executed.  Only 48.68% of 417 branches were
executed.  This does not seem unreasonable since I was only testing a few 
specific functions and related functions that were called by those functions.
The more important aspect was how many lines of code were actually used 
within in the functions I called for testing listed in dominion.c.gcov.
