	URLs with a query string marked invalid

	UrlValidator.java

	Serious Bug

	Can be reproduced everytime

	Run UrlValidator.java
	Pass any URL with a query (ie - "http://www.google.com?action=view") to method isValid()
	Always returns false (it is invalid)

	isValid() should return true, as these are legitimate URLs

	This bug does not result in a crash, but is noted as a serious bug as it's function is wrong.
	It is marked serious as this product cannot ship with this bug, due to being fundamentally wrong.

	Bug manifests at line 446 of URLValidator.java

	446	return !QUERY_PATTERN.matcher(query).matches();

	This returns the opposite boolean it should.
