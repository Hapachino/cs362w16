Bugs: 

councilRoomFunc: 

Instead of adding a buy I am subtracting a buy. I also allowed for the player to draw 5 cards instead of 4 cards by removing the check to see if the i in the each other player draws a card for loop is the current player. 

adventurerFunc: 

I removed the check to see if the card drawn is gold. I also increased the amount of drawn treasure from 2 to 3. 

remodelFunc: 

Inside of the for loop for discard the trashed card i changed the == to a != so that it will trash the first card that is not the card that is supposed to be trashed. 

smithyFunc: 

I changed the for loop to go from i = 0 to 3 to i = 1 to 3
