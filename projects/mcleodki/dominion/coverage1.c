Unit Test Coverage

Each unit test had a very small portion of dominion.c covered, ranging from about 15%-25% of coverage. Considering I am only testing very few functions from this code, that is not as bad of a number as it seems. Branch coverage was also expectedly low, with a range of 18%-30% of the branches covered by my unit tests. This again is due to the small portion of the code that my tests are trying to cover. 

Card Test Coverage

Line coverage of the dominion.c file by my card tests ranged from 20%-24%. Branch coverage had a range of 21%-25%, which is a smaller range than my unit tests. I need to work on not only testing the boundary cases, but finding and testing the more obscure cases that happen less frequently in the game.

Overall

My coverage doesn't seem too bad considering the small portion of the overall code that I am testing. Gcov is a really neat way to see what my code is actually doing!
