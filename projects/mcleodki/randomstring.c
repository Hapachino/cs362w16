   inputChar():
   I used ascii table numbers to generate random characters.
   
   
   inputString():
   This function also makes use of ascii numbers to generate random characters.
   The characters fill 5 spaces of 6 available in an array. The string is null-terminated 
   with a hard-coded '\0'. The program checks this new array for 'reset.'
   Using this implementation, the program was able to find the 'reset' 
   error in 6041655 implementations.
