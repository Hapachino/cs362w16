/*
All of my test have 100% coverage because they are written to execute every
statement. As for Dominion, my test suit currently executes 33% of the file
dominion.c. This seems like it is a good start for a test suite, thought it
is important to remember that not all of the executed code is being tested.
the initializing function is called in every test however it is not tested.
