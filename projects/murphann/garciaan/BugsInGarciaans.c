/*
  Bugs In Play Adventurer:
    -Deals extra Cards
    -does not correctly discard non-tresure Cards
    -Draws more than two Tresure

Discoverd by running my random tests and unit and card tests. Did not have to
refactor any code as my tests ran from the cardEffect function rather than
spacific function names. Output is in unittestresults.out and random.out.
