/*
  Bugs Found In Adventurer:
    -Program has a Segmentation Fault whenever the Adventurer card is played

  Bugs Found In Smithy:
    -Incorrect number of cards in hand and Discard pile after Smithy is played


Discoverd by running my random tests and unit and card tests. Did not have to
refactor any code as my tests ran from the cardEffect function rather than
spacific function names. Output is in unittestresults.out and random.out.
