I filled in the functions inputChar() and inputString() in order to test the testme() function.
First I created an array with valid and invalid characters. For the inputChar() function I entered
multiple of each unwanted characters in order to increase the likelihood of them being selected.
I used a rand() to get a random number whith was used to select from the array of characters. For the
randomstring function a number of characters for the string was randomly selected and then it was filled
with randomly selected characters. If a string of length 5 was selected then the string reset and returned.
I ran the file and it was working as expected. The error message is eventually printed.
