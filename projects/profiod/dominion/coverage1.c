My tests managed to hit 100% statement coverage for each function and card tested. I also test every branch of my chosen cards and functions as well. This is shown by all of the lines having at least been visited once in the cards and functions. I feel that my boundary coverage is not high. I did not see places where testing for boundaries would fit for my cards and functions. I think this is the testing that I would need to improve on the most. 

I also think that the amount of times I hit each statement is worrisome. Several of my tests only hit the if or else section of some conditional statements once. I think that random testing would help with this. I am testing specifically trying to trigger the different things the functions do. I only do that once for some of the functions. This could be improved upon in the future.
