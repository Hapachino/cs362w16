Coverage:

47.25%

My coverage was statement based coverage. Looking at each line of the code I would try to input data to effect it somehow. I think that this number is low because I was not writing tests for the entire dominion.c file but just for certain functions. I think 4 cards and 4 functions are less than 47.25% of all the dominion.c code but other methods are called within the functions being tested so perhaps that's where the higher number came from. There is obviously room for improvement on my test suite. I would have liked to have given more complex input and perfromed some random testing but there were a lot of different methods and struct coming into play and for this project I did not include as many random test as would have been preferred. The area I neglected to test was the effect of the other players hand and confirming that a drawn card was what it was supposed to be.
