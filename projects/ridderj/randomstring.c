Quiz 2 - Jason Ridder

My mission in this code testing was to execute the
printf("error ") statement. That help narrow what
random out put from inputChar() and inputString()
should be. After looking at the code, I settled on
the random values for the string s to from a-z and
 that word was 5 characters long. This kept the
 search under 11,881,376. I would of liked to run
every possible combination of random characters but
that would of taken forever. 

My program might not be the most efficent at
finding the "error" but it does satisfy the
requirent for the quiz 2. The requirements for the
assignment wasn't to find the correct result in
a certain matter of time. So I didn't waste any
more "resources" on it after I had acomplished it.
