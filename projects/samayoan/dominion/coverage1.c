Documentation of code coverage from testing
Onid: samayoan

Use gcov to measure code coverage for all of these tests. Report your findings by discussing your tests' coverages (statement, branch, boundary,
etc.), and describe their implications for the tests in a file called coverage1.c, also checked in to your dominion directory. I want you to look at the dominion code
coverage and find out what parts of your code are not covered so that in future you can improve your test suite.
