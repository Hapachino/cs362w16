Question 2)

UpdateCoins function takes 3 parameters: first parameter is an int value that show the current players number, the second parameter is a pointer to gameState struct, the third parameter is an int value that show the bonus if there is any. The function resets the coin counts to zero and then creates a loop starting from to handCount array. The max value of handCount array is the number of maximum players. Inside the loop basically check each hand; if it is copper adds one, for silver two and for gold it adds three. At the end of the function it adds the bonus to the current coins. disCard function takes 4 parameters handPos is and currentPlayer and trashFlags are an int value and state is a  pointer to the gameState struct. if you have less than 2 smithy cards and if you have money that four or above, you may buy a smithy card.  Smithy is an action card when played the user draws additional three card.  Adventurer card is another action card which allows you to search through your draw pile until you find two treasure cards which are placed in your hand. All other cards searched through are discarded. First step is shuffle the discard pile if the draw pile is empty. It will draw the top card if it is a treasure (copper, silver, gold) then hold in hand and discard any cards that is not tressure and repeat this for the second card.
