1.	Explain testIsValid Function of UrlValidator test code:
	testIsValid calls two functions: 
		testIsValid(testUrlParts, UrlValidator.ALLOW_ALL_SCHEMES);
			-creates new UrlValidator object
			-asserts "http://www.google.com" is valid
			-asserts "http://www.google.com/" is valid
			-do while urls exist to test
			-creates new StringBuffer object
			-combines separate url elements into single url
			-calls isValid() on the url and stores result
			-compares the result with the expected result
			-if result = true, print out the url to the console
		setUp();
			-makes each index of the url = 0

2.	Give how many total number of urls it is testing:
	-testUrlScheme 		= 9
	-testUrlAuthority 	= 19
	-testUrlPort		= 7
	-testPath			= 10
	-testUrlQuery 		= 3
		9 * 19 * 7 * 10 * 3 = 35910 URL's

3.	Explain how it is building all the urls:
	Each url has the following parts: scheme, authority, port, path, and query.  
	Each part is stored in a different ResultPair array.  Each array element 
	contains a string and a boolean value. The function then loops through every
	combination of the ResultPair arrays and matches the result with an AND 
	operation of the boolean value in each array element.

4.	Give an example of valid url being tested and an invalid url:
	valid URL:		http://www.google.com:80/test1?action=view
	invalid URL:	http:/www.google.com:80/test1?action=view

5.	Do you think that a real world test is very different than the unit tests and 
	card tests that we wrote?
	The real world test and the tests used in the Dominion code base are 
	very similar.  In both tests, an object is created, the test is run given 
	various possible inputs expected, and then compared to what is expected.
