For my random testers I used my unit tests as a model for what I wanted to accomplish. I made sure that all of my random numbers were in the domain of possible numbers for the properties in the game state that I was setting as I did not want to force a program crash outside of the function or create bugs that were not there. 

I started developing the adventurer random tester first. I utilized the same structure of printing when discovering an error. Since I introduced bugs to the adventurer function I knew that it was going to error at least some of the time. It ended up erroring everytime ran and I did not see a pattern. That is when I realized I should print the previous and the actual in addition to the description of the error. I also decided to print the run that I was on so that I could see if it was every run that these errors were happening on. Once I upped the amount of runs from 100 to 1000 it became too difficult to track each run so I added a running total of errors and a print error percentage at the end of the tester. This let me see that it truly is 100% of the time there is an error encoutered. 

The strange thing that I found was that with certain runs there are 3 cards being returned, but only two of those cards are treasure cards. This is shown by the fact that my test for two cards added post function fails, but my test for two treasure cards added post function does not fail. I don't believe this is related to the bug that I implemented. I checked my random tester several times to make sure that I am calculating new treasure and previous treasure amounts correctly, and to my knowledge I am. I did have to force at least two treasure cards to be present as I noticed a possible infinite loop in adventurer if two treasure cards were not present. 

For my other card I chose the village card. This is because it is not a card that I added an error to. I wanted to have one test that worked perfectly well (hypothetically). My first run at the random tester was failing though. It was showing that we had an extra card. I hypothesized that it was error coming from the game state as the logs were showing that it only happened after the 10th run and on. I'm not sure what it was, but after moving intialize game to the interior of my for loop it was fixed. I was concerned about running initialize game a thousand times as it is seeding the random number generator used by the game multiple times, but that does not seem to have caused an error. For that reason I moved the initialize game function into the interior of my for loop in the random tester for adventurer as well. It did not change my output results. 

In both out files I see that I am hitting 100% coverage for the functions. Each line/branch is run hundreds of times.
