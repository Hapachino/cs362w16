In testing shuffle I may have found a bug when the deck is at 0 the discard pile is 
supposed to shuffle back into the deck.  During my test this did not occur.  This
could also be a misunderstandin on my part between discard and played pile.

In testing smithy I found several bugs.  The card is not removed from the hand when played, the deck is not incremented correctly and the right number of cards are not drawn

In testing adventurer i found several bugs.  he card is not removed from the hand when played, the deck is not incremented correctly and the right number of cards are not drawn

in testing the village card the discard action is not correct and the number of actions did not
increase correctly

in testing council_room the discard action did not run correctly and the mumber of buys did not
increase correctly
