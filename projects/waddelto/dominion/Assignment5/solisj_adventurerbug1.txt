In 25000 tests, adventurer had the wrong card count after shuffle 53 times.



Steps to Produce/Reproduce

Adventurer with handsize set to force a shuffle.

in the deck after the shuffle.  The discardCount[currentPlayer]
should be 0 and the deckCount[currentPlayer] should be equal to the 
prior discardCount.
