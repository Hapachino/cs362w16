Is it reproducible: Yes 

Description
===========
in 5000 tests of minion path 2, minion failed to properly discard current
player's hand



Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Run minion with path 2, check discardCount and discardPile for current hand


Expected Results
----------------
DiscardCount[currentPlayer] should increase by handCount[currentPlayer].
DiscardPile[currentPlayer] array should contain cards from hand.



Actual Results
--------------
At least one bug is discard function.  Instead of putting cards into
discard pile, discard puts into played card pile, which essentially trashes
them. 


Workarounds
-----------
none
