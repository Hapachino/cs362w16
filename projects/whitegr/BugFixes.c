Bug Fixes: My bugs were basic and simple to find -

Adventurer Card:
1. Incorrect # of treasures added to player's hand. Treasure count variable incorrectly initilized.
2. Tests also identified that the adventurer card did not discard itself. Add discard.

Smithy Card:
3. Incorrect # of draws occur. Caused by incorrect loop condition.

Council Room Card:
4. Bug in missing logic causes state change to players hand giving them an extra card.

Steward Card:
5. Steward card not discarding. Add discard.
