Bug Fixes: My bugs were basic and simple to find -

Adventure:
Incorrect # of treasures added to player's hand. Treasure count variable incorrectly initilized.
Tests also identified that the adventurer card did not discard itself.

Smithy:
Incorrect # of draws occur. Caused by incorrect loop condition.
