In both random testers, I randomized the contents of the deck as this was the most widely variable part of input. For the adventurer test, I inserted a random number of treasure cards and non-treasure cards but ensured that there would be at least three treasure cards, because the function focuses on drawing them. In the council_room test, I randomized the number of players and all cards in the deck. Both full-deck and empty-deck tests were performed for each card in random conditions.
Coverage was roughly the same as the non-randomized versions of these tests, though some runs of the adventurer test actually had less coverage if the top two cards of the randomized deck were treasure; in these cases, the adventurer function did not have to run the branches that dealt with discarding non-treasure cards.
